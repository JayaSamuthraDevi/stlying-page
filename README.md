Here's a brief explanation of ARIA principles and WCAG principles, tailored for frontend developers:

ðŸ”· ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Principles

Purpose: ARIA helps make dynamic web content (like modals, tabs, sliders) accessible to people using assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers).

Key Concepts:

Roles: Tell assistive tech what an element is (role="button", role="dialog").

States and Properties: Describe the current condition of an element (aria-expanded="true").

Live Regions: Notify screen readers when content changes dynamically (aria-live="polite").

Why It Matters:

Native HTML elements are accessible by default. But when using custom elements (like div-based buttons), ARIA fills the gap.

ARIA does not make elements interactive â€“ you still need to handle keyboard and mouse events manually.

Best Practices:

Use semantic HTML first. Only use ARIA when native elements wonâ€™t work.

Don't overuse or misuse ARIA â€“ it can harm accessibility.

Always test with a screen reader if you're using ARIA.

ðŸ”· WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) Principles

Purpose: WCAG provides global standards to make web content more accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

4 WCAG Principles (POUR):

Perceivable

Content must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

Examples:

Provide alt text for images.

Use captions for videos.

Ensure color contrast is readable.

Operable

Interface must be usable via keyboard and other assistive devices.

Examples:

All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible.

Provide skip to content links.

Avoid flashing content that could trigger seizures.

Understandable

Content and UI must be intuitive and predictable.

Examples:

Use clear labels and instructions.

Maintain consistent navigation.

Provide error messages with guidance.

Robust

Content must be compatible with current and future user agents (like screen readers).

Examples:

Use valid HTML.

Use ARIA properly.

Avoid breaking standard behaviors.

Compliance Levels:

A = Minimum

AA = Recommended for most websites (legal requirement in many regions)

AAA = Highest (difficult to achieve)

âœ… For Frontend Developers:

Use semantic HTML whenever possible.

Make sure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.

Add ARIA attributes only when necessary.

Follow WCAG AA as a baseline.

Use tools like:

Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools)

axe DevTools

WAVE accessibility checker

Screen reader testing (VoiceOver, NVDA)
